### What the Customer Wanted

A motorbike to be driven remotely. So that climatic testing can be done without a rider. The objective was for me to take a half finished project both physically and with software and make it work in 4 months.

### What I Did
###### Approach: Comprehensive review and rewiring of the entire setup to enhance connection robustness.
###### Implementation:
  ###### Rewiring: Reconstructed connections for stability.
  ###### Code Review: Analyzed and tested existing code; found it non-functional.
  ###### Testing: Isolated and tested each actuator for functionality.
  ###### Debugging: Resolved wiring issues and verified actuator operations.
  ###### Function Building: Developed functions incrementally, starting with the front brake.

### Results and Impact
###### Outcomes: Achieved stable connections, fully functional actuators, and a reliable control system.
###### Feedback: Client was satisfied with the robust and efficient system.
###### Improvements: Suggested to add bike mapping, with the GUI you had to manage throttle and clutch independatly. However the rider would do both at the same time. Therefore it would be better with a connected relationship.
###### Client gained company wide backing to continue with the project. And the proof of concept created cash injection.
